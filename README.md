# CatBot (Dog Friendly)

CatBot (Dog Friendly) is a Telegram bot with several cat-related (and, by popular demand, dog-related) features:

- /cat: posts a random cat pic
- /catfact: posts a random cat fact
- /dog: posts a random dog pic
- /dogfact: posts a random dog fact

It's publicly available on Telegram as https://t.me/randomcatrobot, but with no guarantees of stability or uptime.
